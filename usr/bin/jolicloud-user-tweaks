#
# User Tweak #1
#
# Set up default bookmarks for Nautilus, prior to the execution of
# xdg-user-dirs-gtk-update at startup.
#
# While this may seen redundant, there's a weird use-case that requires this
# tweak. Basically, if a new user is created and they go to login, no
# .gtk-bookmarks file will exist. When the gnome-session runs
# jolicloud-user-tweaks, it adds in the "Host OS" as designed. But, when
# xdg-user-dirs runs, it will not populate "Documents" "Music" "Pictures",
# or "Videos" on its own.
#
# Since its way too complicated to extend xdg-user-dirs to handle Tweak #2,
# Tweak #1 acts as a contingency to pre-populate the .gtk-bookmarks file so
# xdg-user-dirs-gtk-updates can still do its job: set common user
# directories and bookmarks as properly localized directory names.
#

AddBookmark $HOME/Documents
AddBookmark $HOME/Music
AddBookmark $HOME/Pictures
AddBookmark $HOME/Videos


#
# User Tweak #2
#
# Add a "Host OS" bookmark into Nautilus, but only for Jolicloud Express
# installations that have a /host mount.
